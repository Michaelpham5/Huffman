# Huffman
Huffman Encoding
This program was written on Eclipse in JavaSE-1.8. The program is ran through the driver class. When the program is run, the user will be prompted with 3 options, to build a tree from a file with a string or list of frequencies or to decode a file with encoded strings using another file of listed frequencies. The program can only read files of frequencies in the format of Character-Frequency. When building a tree from an input string, the program will write onto another file the string, a table with the characters, frequencies, and Huffman code, a string representation of the Huffman tree, and the encoded string.  For the second option, the program will write onto another file a table of the characters, frequencies, Huffman code and the tree. The final option is to decode a encoded strings using a list of frequencies. The program is run on a while loop so continuous testing is easier.
